Here are a description of CMake configuration options. These options can be set
via the commandline when CMake is run, or can be viewed/set with GUI tools such
as ccmake or cmake-gui.

CMake configuraiton options:

COMPILER - This should be set to the compiler being used for this project. By
           default, this is set to 'GCC'. NOTE: it should be set to 'ICC' if
           compiling for Xeon Phi.

FTE_EVAL_CHUNK_SIZE - This governs the maximum size of the component buffer (in
                      MB) that will be evaluated at one time. The driver program
					  will subdivide the computation into N chunks based upon
					  the provided user command-line inputs and the value of
					  FTE_EVAL_CHUNK_SIZE. NOTE: This should always be less than
					  the total memory available to the program.

FTE_INIT_COMPONENTS - This enables/disables the use of a random number generator
                      to create component values in the range [0.0, 1.0). When
                      disabled, the evaluation will be done on garbage inputs.
                      Given that we are only looking at how fast we can evaluate
                      fault-trees, it is much faster to simply allocate a buffer
                      of inputs instead of both allocating and initializing a
                      list of components. The amount of work done by the tree
                      evaluation is the same regardless of initialization. Thus
                      disabling initialization makes it easier to compare
                      evaluation performance on large data sets. This variable
                      is set to 'OFF' by default.

FTE_ISPC_EVAL_ENABLED - This enables/disables the use of the ISPC code path for
                        evaluating the fault-tree. This can be used to compare
                        scalar C++ and ISPC evaluation code to see SIMD
                        performance gains. The comparision is the most clear
                        when FTE_THREADING is set to 'OFF' so multi-threading
                        does not impact the comparision between scalar and
                        vector code. This variable is set to 'ON' by default.

FTE_ISPC_PACKET_SIZE - This governs the size of ISPC packets to be evaluated
                       by a thread at the same time. This variable is set to
                       '16' by default and can be mostly left alone.

FTE_THREADING - This variable enables/disables the use of OpenMP threads to
                parallelize evaluations across cores. This variable is set to
                'ON' by default.

XEON_ISA - This governs the target that ISPC will compile to when not compiling
           for Xeon Phi. It ought to be set to the most advanced instruction set
           supported by your compiler/CPU. This variable is set to 'AVX' by
           default.
